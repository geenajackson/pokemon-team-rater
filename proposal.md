### Capstone 1 Proposal

1. What goal will the Pokemon Team Rater achieve?
   > The Pokemon Team Rater (PTR) is designed for users to create teams of Pokemon and allow other users to rate and comment on these teams. Users will create a team of up to six Pokemon via the PokeAPI and can describe why they have chosen those specific Pokemon for their team. Users can also get more information on a specific Pokemon within the team, such as its type and moveset.
  
2. What is the demographic of the Pokemon Team Rater?
   > The PTR is designed for users of all ages who love Pokemon! These are primarily people who love the games and the battling system, but casual enjoyers of the series who also enjoy creating teams not necessarily for battling purposes can use the platform to create their own teams, such as aesthetically pleasing teams or a team full of only Ditto.

3. What data will the Pokemon Team Rater use?
   > The PTR will use the PokeAPI to retrieve information on all existing Pokemon and allow users to choose whichever Pokemon they desire for their team. The PokeAPI is very in-depth about the different aspects of a Pokemon, but this app is primarily concerned with which Pokemon it is, its type, and what moves the Pokemon can have.

4. What is the approach to creating the Pokemon Team Rater?
   > Users will create a secure account with a username and password, and sensitive areas of the app, such as editing a team or commenting on a build, can only be done by logged-in users. Each Team will be linked to a User, and within each Team there will be a linked Pokemon that can be checked for more information. Please check [this spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1k1ZTxcB8bcpWEmSJAUhvMeVmuvnF4aHW0iUwm7AYl3E/edit?usp=sharing) to see the PTR's database schema.

   > Once logged in, Users can create a new team and search for the Pokemon that they want in a team. Once the desired Pokemon are added, the user can make any additional comments on the team build and upload it to the app's main page, which will display recent team builds. Other users can then view this team and rate and comment on it via the team's specific page. The team's creator can update or delete the team at any time, but only for teams that they have created. Ratings cannot be changed.

   > Additional features that can be implemented include specifying what ability the Pokemon has, displaying the stats of the Pokemon, and showing fun facts about the Pokemon, such as its height and weight.
